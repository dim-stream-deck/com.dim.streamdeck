### Clone the repo

To work with this plugin you can simply clone the code repository:

### Install the cli

This CLI is required to develop plugins for the Elgato Stream Deck.

You're ready, you can now test your changes using only `cd ../.. && bun dev`.

Usually actions on the plugin have a relative code also on [DIM](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM), follow their [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to setup your local instance.
